## 2.0.1 (June 14, 2019)

- Fixed: Setting/updating a store to a new primitive value, then setting/updating the store to the same value from its subscriptions would prevent `reflect` from being called
- Fixed: Setting/updating a subscriptionless store to the primitive value it already had could cause a spurious `reflect` call

## 2.0.0 (June 13, 2019)

- Changed: `reflect` is now either a function with signature `(reflecting, set)` or an object with interface `{ withOld(reflecting, old, set) }`. Async-ness is determined by whether the function accepts a `set` parameter, just as for the `derive` callback.
- Changed: The `reflect` callback now runs *after* subscriptions. Additional `set`/`update` calls while running subscriptions result in `reflect` being called only once with the most recent value.
- Changed: Changes to which operations cause a subscription-less `writableDerived` to subscribe-then-unsubscribe to all origins:
	- `set` method calls now do so
	- Getting old origin values in `reflect` no longer does so
- Optimization: Origin values are no longer kept if `reflect` will not need them
- Optimization: Participates in Svelte v3.5.0's [diamond dependencies solution](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/2955) (downstream only; there is no diamond dependency handling for reflecting values back to their sources)
- Optimization: No more internal writable store; the `derived` is the only internal store remaining

## 1.0.1 (June 7, 2019)

- Fixed: First subscription was getting its first call before `derive` ran
- Optimization: Internal derived store is no longer set; all sets go to the internal writable store (replaced with a different optimization in 2.0.0)

## 1.0.0 (June 2, 2019)
