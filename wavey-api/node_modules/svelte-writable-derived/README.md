For users of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) v3, this is a read-write variant of Svelte's [derived stores](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/derived-stores) that accepts an extra callback to send values back to the source. It builds on the derived & writable stores provided by Svelte, and emulates their behavior as closely as possible.

## Default export: `writableDerived()`

<i>Parameters: `origins` ([store](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores) or array of stores), `derive` (function), [`reflect`](#new-parameter-reflect) (see documentation), optional `initial` (any)</i><br>
<i>Returns a store with [`writable`](https://svelte.dev/docs#writable) methods</i>

Create a store that behaves similarly to [Svelte's `derived`](https://svelte.dev/docs#derived), with `origins`, `derive`, and `initial` working like its 1st, 2nd, and 3rd parameters respectively. Values introduced to the store via its `set` and `update` methods are passed to the new 3rd parameter, `reflect`, which can in turn set values for the origin stores.

It is not possible for `derived` and `reflect` to trigger calls to each other, provided they only use the `set` callbacks provided to them and do not reach out to any outer `set` or `update`.

### New parameter: `reflect`

<i>One of the following:</i>
* <i>Function with parameters: `reflecting` (any), optional `set` (function)</i>
* <i>Object with property `withOld` containing function with parameters: `reflecting` (any), `old` (any), optional `set` (function)</i>

The provided function is called when the derived store gets a new value via its `set` and `update` methods (not via the `derive` callback). Its `reflecting` parameter is this new value. The `set` parameter accepts a value to set in the origin store, if `origins` was a store, or an array of values to set if `origins` was an array. If the `set` parameter receives an array that's sparse or shorter than `origins`, it will only set the stores it has elements for, and other stores don't necessarily need to be writable. If the function doesn't take a `set` parameter, its return value will be used to set origin stores just as if it were passed to `set`.

`reflect` is called after the derived store's subscriptions are called. If the derived store has its `set` and/or `update` methods called again in the process of calling its subscriptions, `reflect` will be called only once, with the most-recently-set value.

If `reflect` takes a `set` parameter, it may return a cleanup function that will be called immediately before the next `reflect` call. (Unlike its `derive` counterpart, `reflect`'s cleanup function is never called in response to unsubscriptions.)

If the `reflect` parameter is provided a function via an object with a `withOld` property, that function will be called with an additional `old` parameter after `reflecting`. This is the initial value of the origin stores, and will be an array if `origins` was an array.

## Regarding Subscription-less `writableDerived` Stores

One of the ways `writableDerived` emulates the behavior of Svelte's `derived` is that it does not subscribe to any origin store until the derived store itself has a subscription. However, `writableDerived` makes an exception: Calling the `set` and `update` methods when the derived store has no subscriptions will subscribe to & then unsubscribe from all its origins.

## Examples

### Making an object store from a JSON string store

```javascript
import { writable, get } from "svelte/store";
import writableDerived from "svelte-writable-derived";

var jsonStore = writable(`{"I'm a property": true}`);
var objectStore = writableDerived(
	jsonStore,
	(json) => JSON.parse(json),
	(object) => JSON.stringify(object)
);
console.log( Object.keys( get(objectStore) ) ); // ["I'm a property"]
objectStore.set({"I'm not a property": false});
console.log( get(jsonStore) ); // "{\"I'm not a property\": false}"
```

### Making a single-value store from an object store

```javascript
import { writable, get } from "svelte/store";
import writableDerived from "svelte-writable-derived";

var objectStore = writable({"a horse": "a horse", "of course": "of course"});
var valueStore = writableDerived(
	objectStore,
	(object) => object["a horse"],
	{ withOld(reflecting, object) {
		object["a horse"] = reflecting;
		return object; // needed to ensure objectStore.set is called with the proper value
	} }
);
console.log( get(valueStore) ); // "a horse"
valueStore.set("*whinny*");
console.log( get(objectStore) ); // {"a horse": "*whinny*", "of course": "of course"}
```

### Making an object store from several single-value stores

```javascript
import { writable, get } from "svelte/store";
import writableDerived from "svelte-writable-derived";

var valueStore1 = "sparta", valueStore2 = "monty python's flying circus";
var objectStore = writableDerived(
	[valueStore1, valueStore2],
	([value1, value2]) => ( {"this is": value1, "it's": value2} ),
	(object) => [ object["this is"], object["it's"] ]
);
console.log( get(objectStore) ); // {"this is": "sparta", "it's": "monty python's flying circus"}
objectStore.set( {"this is": "rocket league", "it's": "over 9000"} );
console.log( get(valueStore1), get(valueStore2) ); // "rocket league" "over 9000"
```

### Chaining all of the above together

```javascript
// What if Rube Goldberg were a JavaScript developer?
import { writable, get } from "svelte/store";
import writableDerived from "svelte-writable-derived";

var jsonStore = writable(`{"owner": "dragon", "possessions": ["crown", "gold"]}`);
var hoardStore = writableDerived(
	jsonStore,
	(json) => JSON.parse(json),
	(object) => JSON.stringify(object)
);

var hoarderStore = writableDerived(
	objectStore,
	(hoard) => hoard["owner"],
	{ withOld(reflecting, hoard) {
		hoard["owner"] = reflecting;
		return hoard;
	} }
);
var hoardContentsStore = writableDerived(
	objectStore,
	(hoard) => hoard["possessions"],
	{ withOld(reflecting, hoard) {
		hoard["possessions"] = reflecting;
		return hoard;
	} }
);

var itemListStore = writableDerived(
	[hoarderStore, hoardContentsStore],
	([hoarder, hoardContents]) => {
		return hoardContents.map( (item) => {
			return {item, owner: hoarder};
		});
	},
	(itemList) => {
		// This is only for demonstration purposes, so we won't handle differing owners
		var hoarder = itemList[0].owner;
		var hoardContents = itemList.map( (itemListEntry) => {
			return itemListEntry["item"];
		} );
		return [hoarder, hoardContents];
	}
);

jsonStore.subscribe(console.log);
hoardStore.subscribe(console.log);
hoarderStore.subscribe(console.log);
// skipping hoardContentsStore
itemListStore.subscribe(console.log);
itemListStore.update( (itemList) => {
	return itemList.map( (itemListEntry) => {
		return {item: itemListEntry.item, owner: "protagonist"};
	} );
} );
/*
	Upon the update, the console logs:
	[{item: "crown", owner: "protagonist"}, {item: "gold", owner: "protagonist"}]
	"protagonist"
	{owner: "protagonist", possessions: ["crown", "gold"]}
	"{\"owner\": \"protagonist\", \"possessions\": [\"crown\", \"gold\"]}"
*/
```

## Browser compatibility

This package should run anywhere Svelte can run. Use transpilers/polyfills as needed.
